## Cache scripts
This directory contains python scripts that load raw data, performance analysis, and cache results to be used for generating figures. A brief summary of the analyses follows:

#### Figure 1
* No analysis scripts are included for the results in Figure 1 or Fig 1 S1. Summary data used to produce the figure is included directly in the dryad data repository.

#### Figure 2
* Mean catch vs. target response: `cache_uTar_uCat.py` -- produces: `tar_vs_cat.csv`
* Single neuron d-prime: `cache_singleNeuronDprime.py` -- produces: `singleNeuronDprime.csv`
